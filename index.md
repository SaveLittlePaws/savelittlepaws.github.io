## Welcome to Save Little Paws

We are a free, charity cat sanctuary based in Pakistan.

We take in kittens and cats off the street and give them medical care, feed them, clean them and rehabilitate them to try and get them re-homed and adopted into loving families.

At any one time we have 15-30 cats and kittens. 

Do you have a cat who needs help? Come and visit us, or perhaps adopt one of our cats home to join your family! :)
